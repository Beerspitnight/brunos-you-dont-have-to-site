                                <p>I'm an idiot. You should not listen. You should not think that I know what I'm about. Hello boys and Welcome to Bruno's You Don't Have To, the short form podcast for all of us awesome people. This is episode 21. If you like what you're hearing, hit the like button, leave a comment, I'll write you back. Tell your friends. These three minutes occupy six hours of my day, twice a week. I was born in one of the whitest towns in one of the most Republican counties in New Jersey. I believe there was one African-American student in high school. They had him in a separate room. The school called it pull out. They just isolated the kid from the rest of us. And that eventually led to him setting cars on fire. And not just a few cars, 14 cars. To a crisp. They should've just let the kid hang out with us. Although he did stab Robbie in the thigh with a pen. I went to a college that was very white. The ghetto night party was not a good idea, but the apology that we wrote to the school was very sincere. After college, I took a job working in DC. I had a ride-along that first week I was in DC so you learn the accounts and we're driving through Southeast DC. What he liked to do if he saw a group of black teenagers was to make them think that we were the police. That didn't seem like a good idea to me. We were driving a white minivan full of cases of Heineken beer. We had to leave that beer in the white minivan while we went into the accounts. And those kids obviously lived in the neighborhood. And I thought this is not a good idea. I was going to say something to him, but I was the new guy. He had literally just called me the FNG about an hour before. So I didn't say shit. When we came out of the account, the white minivan was gone. I don't blame the kids. If I was 17 and sitting on a street corner and some douche bag came around acting like he was the police just for shits and giggles. And he parked that white minivan outside the strip club he went into. And I looked in the back of that minivan and it was full of Heineken beer. I'd fucking take it too. I remember driving around DC and noticing sharply dressed black men in suits on street corners, holding pamphlets and what appeared to be pies. The first time I was out walking around and I saw a well-dressed black man on a street corner holding pies and pamphlets in his hands, I walked up to him. I said, excuse me, sir. He turned his head away from me, and walked away because I was white. I was bummed. I wanted to hear his spiel. I really wanted to know what was in the pies, how much they were, how I could get myself some. That was my only interaction with the Nation of Islam. Until last week when I needed a haircut and I walked into a barbershop. Inside the barbershop was a black man cutting another black man's hair and numerous posters of Malcolm X on the wall. And I was hesitant for a second because of my past experiences. But here's your opportunity to find out about the pies.</p>

                                <p>Hello boys and girls welcome to bruno's you don't have to the short form podcast for all of us awesome midlife people. If this podcast was a private entity and ownership was divided by listenership, we would have 45% of our board members being women. Nice job ladies. This is the 20th episode of bruno's you don't have to. Thanks for listening. Tell your friends. I have never been one for pomp and ceremony. Graduations, I won't even get started on kindergarten graduations, weddings, church. I was raised Catholic, but I always found it really silly praying to these statues, going into that little room telling all your dirty deeds through a screen to an old man who back in the day touched a lot of boys in Ireland. All the pictures and the symbolism. I can appreciate it. It just wasn't my thing. That's not to say I'm not spiritual, not to mention that one summer it was August. It was really hot outside the air-conditioning wasn't working. We had to go to church. Father Joe was leading service. Father Joe was 350 pounds and he was sweating profusely. He got done with that mass in 12 minutes. I remember thinking what the fuck? I got a beer for 45 minutes. We can be done with this in 12 minutes? What the fuck? I respect it, it is just not for me. I don't put a lot of value in celebrity. Jeremy Piven doesn't tip by the way, and I don't really care for rituals and ceremonies. I think award ceremonies in particular are rather ridiculous. The Oscars, the Grammys, a bunch of your buddies just giving you an award. Nice job Joe. Thanks, Tim. So I was thinking I need to make a podcast award. So I did. I've been on reddit in the podcasting subreddit and I was speaking with another podcaster, but it wasn't a dude. It's a woman and she's rather easy on the eyes. So I gave her the award and then I sent in press releases to some different organizations and I had to fake it. I had to fake being a marketing executive at a consulting group that supports podcasts. Is there any money in that? I didn't feel bad about it. Why do only certain people get to promote their products for free? I can't because I have a gmail account. So I skirted the rule. I like rules. Rules are important when they're not stupid. I digress. So the messy minded podcast won the first you don't have to award for independent audio excellence. We are going to promote indie podcasts without a lot of production, something maybe a little edgy, a little raw. Okay, that's not the messy minded podcast now. She's pretty, pretty well put together. You should check out the website. I made for it. It's gonna happen once a month. We're doing awards once a month boys and girls. I'll put the link to the website in the description. My tiktok as of 10 minutes ago, 849 views. Go check me out. I'm trending, baby. She's just you and the pod is legit.</p>

                                <p>Hello boys and girls, mostly boys. Welcome to another episode of Bruno's You Don't Have To, the short form podcast. I've gotten roomed up with another weirdo, the punk rock straight edge kid from Long We got along really well. We attracted quite a crew of misfits. Part of that was we were badass, right? We all wanted tattoos. We wanted to be cool. So we looked in the yellow book, flipped to T, T- A, T- A- T-T, you get the idea. And we settled on a tattoo shop, gave them a call, come on in. That was our introduction to the Hammerskin. That's slightly hyperbolic. We didn't know that they were Hammerskin at the time. They were just tattoo guys. We recognized that maybe they had a different value system than we did, but they didn't talk about it and we didn't talk about it.<br><br>Fast forward three years, I found myself aligned with a motley crew of misfits. We had a house off campus. We heard through the grapevine that a fraternity in town was very upset with us because they had parties on Wednesday nights and they wanted to come kick our ass. We were scared. So we did what any logical, scared group of kids would do. We called up the tattoo shop. Bill answered. I said, Bill, we have this situation. Frat boys want to come over and kick our ass. Would you and some of your buddies want to come over and just kind of hang out? He said yes.<br><br>Before the party, Bill and two other guys that we knew from the shop showed up, along with three other guys who we'd never met before. We sent them downstairs to the basement, where the keg is. Bill's friend pulls me aside and he said, hey Bri, just in case, and he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out this pistol that's like the size of the palm of his hand. I'm like, dude, no guns, man. I also remember about 30 seconds later, 25 frat boys walked down the steps of our basement with looks of aggression on their faces. The five skinheads turned around, looked at them, and the frat boys walked over the keg and filled it up and hung out for 20 minutes, said thank you, and left.<br><br>I always found people who lived outside the bounds of normal society to be interesting. I didn't agree with Bill's thoughts or his buddies. It was also never a conversation. Bill never asked us our beliefs. We never asked him his. This all came to a dramatic conclusion. I worked for the local beer distributor. I remember Bill at one point had spoken to me about a buddy of his who died from an illness and they were going to hold a benefit for him and he asked me if I could get a deal on some kegs for this party. I said yeah, sure. The next day my boss gave me the local paper. On the front page was a picture of one of our beer trucks delivering kegs of beer to what the headline described as the hammer skin meeting. I didn't go over so well.</p>

                                <p>Hello boys and girls, mostly boys age 35 to 44. Welcome to another episode of Bruno's You Don't Have To. Dogs like, and I like dogs. I'm a dog person. I don't want another dog. And that's what I was thinking about recently. I started contemplating retirement some years ago when I thought I'd be able to retire. I'm never going to be able to retire. It's okay. And I thought how cool it'd be to throw a camper on the back of my pickup truck and a dog and drive up to Nova Scotia and wait for the stripers to start running south, follow them to Virginia and then do whatever. It'd be cool to have the companionship of a dog until I really started thinking about it. We had a dog in China. We bought it at a market. It cost $3.79 in 2008 US dollars. I remember taking it to the vet and the vet said, you're going to need to get it spayed in probably six to nine months. The next day I woke up, went downstairs and there was all this brown shit all over the floor, but it wasn't shit. No, it was blood because the dog needed to be neutered the day before because she had her fucking period. I had to call up the driver, have him come over and take me to the veterinary store to go buy a panty liner... it was terrible. The Chinese man just laughed at me and I never enjoyed walking the dog. Taking a dog out to go take a shit is dehumanizing. I also don't like cats and the cats in China were fucking nuts. If you've never seen a Chinese feral cat, you should go check one out because they are fucking massive. They will attack you. My entire yard smelled like cat piss and shit. They used the trampoline as their own little sleeping mat covered in hair. It smelled like shit. So I used to get the dog all riled up. Ready, go get those cats. The dog would go after the cats who would stay on their ground. Dog comes running back inside. Fuck that. One day I went up to the veterinary lady and I said to her, "Hey, I got a cat problem. I got a feral cat problem." And she listened to me and she's like, "I have the perfect program for you. First thing we do, we trap the cats." I'm like, "that's cool, man. Let's trap them." And she's like, "and then we neuter them." Like, "fuck yeah, cut off their balls. Come on." And then she said, "we released them." I said, "where?" She said, "well, back in the neighborhood." What the fuck?</p>

                                <p>Hello boys and girls and I was gonna say mostly boys in a whisper. But I'm not this time because our female listenership is up to 43% boom. Welcome to Bruno's you don't have to the short form podcast where I try to make you chuckle one time in four minutes or less. I usually fail. I used to try to plan for these episodes, but I never know what to say until I start talking today's no different. That's why it takes me like 18 hours to make a single three-minute podcast. When I was a kid growing up, my dad used to take me to the liquor store with him a lot of times. We would go to the drive-thru liquor store. That was an idea, huh? Let's pull in, we'll give you a whole case of beer. It was whatever you need right in your car. They also gave me a pretzel stick. Might be the reason why I like pretzels so much as an adult. Yesterday, I went to the dispensary and a lot of dispensaries around here are buying up old banks. Which is really cool because then you have a drive-thru. Drive-thru pickups of marijuana is a whole lot easier than having me go online inside. I choose that option. I was in line yesterday. The woman in front of me was driving a minivan and she was obviously a mom. There was a child's head poking up over the rear seat. Obviously on a screen because the head was slightly downturned. My initial thought... Why would you bring your kid here? Besides I thought being extremely judgy it also it doesn't make any sense. I want my kids to be potheads. That's a weird thing to say. That's what I want. Booze is so bad for you. Where do these ideas and expectations come from? How do they enter into our brain? For me, it came from the old women in my life, aunts, great aunts, people who consider themselves aunts, that whole crew. These cultural expectations. What are you gonna have a baby? Or after you have a baby? When are you gonna have another baby? Those are all cultural pressures that sometimes we don't even think about. I didn't think there was a different way to go with life. I thought I had to get married. I know I didn't have to. That was the expectation. I started a new job some years back. I remember walking around with a colleague being introduced to my other colleagues and one woman I spoke to, you know, we got to talking and then she starts talking about her family and how she doesn't have any kids. And I just said that's fantastic. Congratulations. You must have so much money. We got done with that conversation. The colleague looks at me. He's like, you can't you can't say stuff like that to people. What do you mean? You can't say to someone congratulations. They're not having kids. What if they wanted kids? I see two positive outcomes here. Either they didn't have kids because they didn't want to have kids and I'm congratulating them so that's fine or they didn't have kids, they wanted to have kids, and now they have a shit ton of money unlike the rest of us. So that's a positive for them too. He was a Catholic though. He thought he had to have like 15 kids. I'm gonna start thinking about where my judginess comes from before I start judging. Jack Kerouac wrote about living a life of non-interference with others and maybe I should keep that in mind next time I am in line at the drive-thru at the dispensary and there is a minivan in front of me driven by a young mom with a child in the backseat and she's just trying to pick up some infused pre-rolls for the weekend. Smoke them if you got them, hon.</p>

                                <p>Hello boys and girls, welcome to another episode of Bruno's You Don't Have To, the short form podcast where I try to make you laugh at least once in three minutes or less. Four minutes. Four minutes or less. Four minutes, plus or minus 30 seconds. It's totally worth three and a half minutes of your time. I thought it was funny, but I always think I'm funny, I'm usually not that funny. I had a boss once tell me that parents give us the best product that they can, being children. I agree with that. I agree with that because every parent fucks up their kid in some way. And by fuck up, I mean like psychologically. They're going to be sitting down on a very comfortable sofa at the age of 35, spilling their guts to a counselor about how that one time their dad wouldn't fucking get them the third scoop of ice cream and ruined their entire fucking understanding of cows. If it's not you fucking them up as their parent, it'll be the drunk Uncle Lester and crazy Aunt Claire who fuck them up, give them anxiety attacks for Christmases to come because Aunt Claire and Uncle Lester are fucking weird. They're all formative experiences because all of these things get implanted into you, they get seeded into your young, malleable, gray-mattered brain. I can think back to those formative experiences that really shaped me as an individual, shaped my personality, shaped my wants, my desires, my memory or pre-memory until our soft, malleable, gray-mattered brains start to harden up a little. That's a scientific term for it. Does it fucking matter? I don't know if it does. We try to make everything so perfect for our kids when nothing's fucking perfect. Ultimately, what do I want to teach them? I want to teach them that the world's a small place, that they should work in service of something other than just themselves, that a liberal arts undergraduate degree is a waste of fucking money. I'd be happy with that. When our eldest was born, I remember going to the New York Times. I had a subscription back then, not anymore. And when I was reading an article, it was a calculator for how much to save for your kids for college. It worked out to be like $525 a month. That calculator wanted me to pay $525 a month to a 529 plan. So in 18 years, after putting away $525 a month times 12 months in a year times 18 years times three fucking kids, you want me to send them off to a college so that they can go get drunk and fuck for four years at a cost of $60,000 a year? What? What? It's the experience. Are you fucking out of your mind? Instead, you take a couple AP classes in high school, you go to community college, get the credit you need. It's a fraction of the cost, nice profile of people there. You can still get laid. You can still drink, but it won't cost you $60,000 a year. Actually, I kind of hope they just are potheads and they just smoke weed. But I digress. If we're going to fuck them up anyway, like, let's do it with some fucking style, people. Let's make it productive, not just everything's fucking roses and snowflakes and you're special and you're unique and you're so special, Jimmy. So special. That Jimmy's so fucking special. I don't think I want to leave my children anything when I die. Let them start from scratch, man. Work that shit up. I don't know. I'm not going to have anything to give them anyway. I want to spend it all. Last second, the last bot gets spent. Bruno's last bot spent in Bangkok. Might be sharks down there. You go check, Jimmy.</p>

                                <p>Hello boys and girls, welcome to another episode of Bruno's You Don't Have To, the short form podcast. What do I mean by short? I mean I will have this done in less than four minutes, I promise, an entertaining four minutes at that. I'm still stuck on the idea of what the fuck did our parents' generation do to fuck us up as parents as badly as they have. I spent a good part of my career supporting kids between 12 and 7. What I came to learn from that experience is that all kids are the same. The good kids, the bad kids, the kids in the middle, they're all the same. They fuck up and then they generally try to cover that shit up, which is just normal. The worst was I would call a parent and say, hey, your kid did this and then they would respond with, my child would never do that. What? Do you forget that you were fucking 14 once and you did stupid shit and you fucking lied about it? I didn't. It's all the same. Now, my son, my son got himself into a bit of a pickle at school before the end of the school year. His mom called me to
